Numerical Solver
- To provide a library of mathematical functions to solve Linear Algebraic problems, such as matrices decomposition (A = LU, or A = LLT, or A = LDLT, etc), equation AX = B, etc.
- To solve problems for both dense and sparse matrices. For dense matrices' problems, BLAS and LAPACK will be used.
